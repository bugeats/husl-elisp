# husl-elisp

Future Emacs Lisp implementation of [HUSL](http://www.husl-colors.org/) to learn me some elisp. I don't actually know what I'm doing.

... and I'm abandoning this project indefinitely. I'd say it's about 80% complete. I learned enough elisp to port over the reference functions.  Some of them may be wrong. Testing in elisp is weird and hard.
